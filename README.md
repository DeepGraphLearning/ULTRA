## Overview ##

ULTRA is a foundation model for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. A single pre-trained ULTRA model performs link prediction tasks on *any* multi-relational graph with any entity / relation vocabulary. Performance-wise averaged on 50+ KGs, a single pre-trained ULTRA model is better **in the 0-shot inference mode** than many SOTA models trained specifically on each graph. 
Following the *pretrain-finetune* paradigm of foundation models, you can run a pre-trained ULTRA checkpoint immediately in the zero-shot manner on any graph as well as use more fine-tuning. 

ULTRA provides **<u>u</u>nified, <u>l</u>earnable, <u>tra</u>nsferable** representations for any KG. Under the hood, ULTRA employs graph neural networks and modified versions of [NBFNet](https://github.com/KiddoZhu/NBFNet-PyG).
ULTRA does not learn any entity and relation embeddings specific to a downstream graph but instead obtains *relative relation representations* based on interactions between relations.

The original implementation with the TorchDrug framework is available [here](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ultra_torchdrug) for reproduction purposes.

This repository is based on PyTorch 2.1 and PyTorch-Geometric 2.4.

## Installation ##

You may install the dependencies via either conda or pip. 
Ultra PyG is implemented with Python 3.9, PyTorch 2.1 and PyG 2.4 (CUDA 11.8 or later when running on GPUs). If you are on a Mac, you may omit the CUDA toolkit requirements.

### From Conda ###

```bash
conda install pytorch=2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=11.8 cudatoolkit=11.8 pytorch-scatter=2.1.2 pyg=2.4.0 -c pytorch -c nvidia -c pyg -c conda-forge
conda install ninja easydict pyyaml -c conda-forge
```

### From Pip ###

```bash
pip install torch==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install torch-scatter==2.1.2 torch-sparse==0.6.18 torch-geometric==2.4.0 -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cu118.html
pip install ninja easydict pyyaml
```

<summary> Compilation of the `rspmm` kernel </summary>

To make relational message passing iteration `O(V)` instead of `O(E)` we ship a custom `rspmm` kernel that will be compiled automatically upon the first launch. The `rspmm` kernel supports `transe` and `distmult` message functions, others like `rotate` will resort to full edge materialization and `O(E)` complexity.

The kernel can be compiled on both CPUs (including M1/M2 on Macs) and GPUs (it is done only once and then cached). For GPUs, you need a CUDA 11.8+ toolkit with the `nvcc` compiler. If you are deploying this in a Docker container, make sure to start from the `devel` images that contain `nvcc` in addition to plain CUDA runtime.

Make sure your `CUDA_HOME` variable is set properly to avoid potential compilation errors, eg
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/
```

</details>


## Checkpoints ##

We provide two pre-trained ULTRA checkpoints in the `/ckpts` folder of the same model size (6-layer GNNs per relation and entity graphs, 64d, 168k total parameters) trained on 4 x A100 GPUs with this codebase:
* `ultra_3g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium` for 800,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/pretrain_3g.yaml`
* `ultra_4g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium, NELL995` for 400,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/pretrain_4g.yaml`

You can use those checkpoints for zero-shot inference on any graph (including your own) or use it as a backbone for fine-tuning. Both checkpoints are rather small (2 MB each).

Zero-shot performance of the checkpoints compared to the paper version (PyG experiments were run on a single RTX 3090, PyTorch 2.1, PyG 2.4, CUDA 11.8 using the `run_many.py` script in this repo):

## Run Inference and Fine-tuning

The `/scripts` folder contains 3 executable files:
* `run.py` - run an experiment on a single dataset
* `run_many.py` - run experiments on several datasets sequentially and dump results into a CSV file
* `pretrain.py` - a script for pre-training ULTRA on several graphs

The yaml configs in the `config` folder are provided for both `transductive` and `inductive` datasets.

### Run a single experiment

The `run.py` command requires the following arguments:
* `-c <yaml config>`: a path to the yaml config
* `--dataset`: dataset name (from the list of [datasets](#datasets))
* `--version`: a version of the inductive dataset (see all in [datasets](#datasets)), not needed for transductive graphs. For example, `--dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1` will load one of the GraIL inductive datasets.
* `--epochs`: number of epochs to train, `--epochs 0` means running zero-shot inference.
* `--bpe`: batches per epoch (replaces the length of the dataloader as default value). `--bpe 100 --epochs 10` means that each epoch consists of 100 batches, and overall training is 1000 batches. Set `--bpe null` to use the full length dataloader or comment the `bpe` line in the yaml configs.
* `--gpus`: number of gpu devices, set to `--gpus null` when running on CPUs, `--gpus [0]` for a single GPU, or otherwise set the number of GPUs for a [distributed setup](#distributed-setup)
* `--ckpt`: path to the one of the ULTRA checkpoints to use (you can use those provided in the repo ot trained on your own). Use `--ckpt null` to start training from scratch (or run zero-shot inference on a randomly initialized model, it still might surprise you and demonstrate non-zero performance).

Zero-shot inference setup is `--epochs 0` with a given checkpoint `ckpt`.

Fine-tuning of a checkpoint is when epochs > 0 with a given checkpoint.


An example command for an inductive dataset to run on a CPU: 

```bash
python script/run.py -c config/inductive/inference.yaml --dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1 --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus null --ckpt ckpts/ultra_4g.pth
```

An example command for a transductive dataset to run on a GPU:
```bash
python script/run.py -c config/transductive/inference.yaml --dataset CoDExSmall --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --ckpt ckpts/ultra_4g.pth
```

### Run on many datasets

The `run_many.py` script is a convenient way to run evaluation (0-shot inference and fine-tuning) on several datasets sequentially. Upon completion, the script will generate a csv file `ultra_results_<timestamp>` with the test set results and chosen metrics. 
Using the same config files, you only need to specify:

* `-c <yaml config>`: use the full path to the yaml config because workdir will be reset after each dataset; 
* `-d, --datasets`: a comma-separated list of [datasets](#datasets) to run, inductive datasets use the `name:version` convention. For example, `-d ILPC2022:small,ILPC2022:large`;
* `--ckpt`: ULTRA checkpoint to run the experiments on, use the full path to the file;
* `--gpus`: the same as in [run single](#run-a-single-experiment);
* `-reps` (optional): number of repeats with different seeds, set by default to 1 for zero-shot inference;
* `-ft, --finetune` (optional): use the finetuning configs of ULTRA (`default_finetuning_config`) to fine-tune a given checkpoint for specified `epochs` and `bpe`;
* `-tr, --train` (optional): train ULTRA from scratch on the target dataset taking `epochs` and `bpe` parameters from another pre-defined config (`default_train_config`);
* `--epochs` and `--bpe` will be set according to a configuration, by default they are set for a 0-shot inference.

An example command to run 0-shot inference evaluation of an ULTRA checkpoint on 4 FB GraIL datasets:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

An example command to run fine-tuning on 4 FB GraIL datasets with 5 different seeds:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth --finetune --reps 5 -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

### Pretraining

Run the pre-training script `pretrain.py` with the `config/transductive/pretrain_<ngraphs>.yaml` config file. 

`graphs` in the config specify the pre-training mixture. `pretrain_3g.yaml` uses FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium; `pretrain_4g.yaml` adds NELL995 to those three. By default, we use the training option `fast_test: 500` to run faster evaluation on a random subset of 500 triples (that approximates full validation performance) of each validation set of the pre-training mixture.
You can change the pre-training length by varying batches per epoch `batch_per_epoch` and `epochs` hyperparameters.

<details>
<summary><b>On the training graph mixture</b></summary>

Right now, 10 transductive datasets are supported for the pre-training mixture in the `JointDataset`: 

* FB15k237
* WN18RR
* CoDExSmall
* CoDExMedium
* CoDExLarge
* NELL995
* YAGO310
* ConceptNet100k
* DBpedia100k
* AristoV4

You can add more datasets (from all 57 implemented as well as your custom ones) by modifying the `datasets_map` in `datasets.py`. By adding inductive datasets you'd need to add proper filtering datasets (similar to that in `test()` function in `run.py`) to have a consistent evaluation protocol.

</details>

An example command to start pre-training on 3 graphs:

```bash
python script/pretrain.py -c /path/to/config/transductive/pretrain_3g.yaml --gpus [0]
```

Pre-training can be computationally heavy, you might need to decrease the batch size for smaller GPU RAM. The two provided checkpoints were trained on 4 x A100 (40 GB).

#### Distributed setup
To run ULTRA with multiple GPUs, use the following commands (eg, 4 GPUs per node)

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 script/pretrain.py -c config/transductive/pretrain.yaml --gpus [0,1,2,3]
```

Multi-node setup might work as well(not tested):
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=4 --nproc_per_node=4 script/pretrain.py -c config/transductive/pretrain.yaml --gpus [0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3]
```

## Datasets

The repo packs 57 different KG datasets of sizes from 1K-120K nodes and 1K-2M edges. Inductive datasets have splits of different `version` and a common notation is `dataset:version`, eg `ILPC2022:small`

All the datasets will be automatically downloaded upon the first run. It is recommended to first download pre-training datasets on single GPU experiments rather than immediately start multi-GPU training to prevent racing conditions.

### Adding your own graph

We provide two base classes in `datasets.py` (based on [`InMemoryDataset`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.data.InMemoryDataset.html) of PyG) that you can inherit from:
* `TransductiveDataset` requires 3 links in the `urls` field by convention `urls = ["train_set_link", "valid_set_link", "test_set_link"]` and `name`. 
<details>
<summary>Code example</summary>

```python
class CustomDataset(TransductiveDataset):

    urls = [
        "link/to/train.txt",
        "link/to/valid.txt",
        "link/to/test.txt",
        ]
    name = "custom_data"
```
</details>

* `InductiveDataset` requires 4 links in the `urls` field by convention `urls = ["transductive_train_set_link", "inference_graph_link", "inference_valid_set_link", "inference_test_set_link"]` and `name`. By default, we assume that validation and test edges are based on `inference_graph` (but you can modify the loaders to account for different combinations).

<details>
<summary>Code example</summary>

```python
class CustomDataset(InductiveDataset):

    urls = [
        "link/to/train.txt",
        "link/to/inference_graph.txt",
        "link/to/inference_valid.txt",
        "link/to/inference_test.txt",
        ]
    name = "custom_data"
```
</details>

TSV / CSV files are supported by setting a delimiter (eg,  `delimiter = "\t"`) in the class definition. 
After adding your own dataset, you can immediately run 0-shot inference or fine-tuning of any ULTRA checkpoint.
