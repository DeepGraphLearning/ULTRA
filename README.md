# ULTRA-LM: Integrating Graph Neural Networks with Language Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning

![ULTRA-LM](asset/ultra_lm.png)

## Overview

This project extends the ULTRA (Unified, Learnable, and Transferable Representations for Knowledge Graphs) framework by integrating Language Models (LMs) to enrich entity-level features. This approach, which we call ULTRA-LM, combines the structural information captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the rich semantic representations provided by LMs.

## Key Features

- Combines GNN-based structural representations with LM-based textual representations
- Enhances link prediction tasks, especially for unseen entities and edges
- Utilizes pre-trained language models (e.g., OpenAI's Ada) for text embedding
- Supports both transductive and inductive learning scenarios

## Implementation Details

ULTRA-LM integrates GNN and LM representations through the following steps:

1. **Graph Representation**: Utilizes ULTRA's existing GNN architecture to capture structural information.
2. **Text Representation**: Employs pre-trained language models to generate embeddings for entity descriptions.
3. **Combined Representation**: Introduces an intermediate layer to concatenate both graph and text features before the entity-level GNN processing.

## Usage

To use ULTRA-LM:

1. Download the pre-trained language model embeddings from [here](https://github.com/acsac24submissionvulnscopper/VulnScopper/releases/download/dataset/redhat_entity2vec.pickle).
2. Place the downloaded file in the ULTRA root directory.
3. Update the `lm_vectors` parameter in `config/ultralm/pretrain.yaml` with the full path to the embeddings file.
4. Run ULTRA-LM using the following command:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 script/pretrain_lm.py -c config/ultralm/pretrain.yaml --dataset RedHatCVE --epochs 10 --bpe null --gpus [0,1]
```

## Dataset

Currently, ULTRA-LM supports the `RedHatCVE` dataset, which contains security vulnerabilities with textual descriptions. This dataset is inductive in nature, with validation and test splits containing only unseen CVEs.

## Overview ##

ULTRA is a foundation model for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. A single pre-trained ULTRA model performs link prediction tasks on *any* multi-relational graph with any entity / relation vocabulary. Performance-wise averaged on 50+ KGs, a single pre-trained ULTRA model is better **in the 0-shot inference mode** than many SOTA models trained specifically on each graph. 
Following the *pretrain-finetune* paradigm of foundation models, you can run a pre-trained ULTRA checkpoint immediately in the zero-shot manner on any graph as well as use more fine-tuning. 

ULTRA provides **<u>u</u>nified, <u>l</u>earnable, <u>tra</u>nsferable** representations for any KG. Under the hood, ULTRA employs graph neural networks and modified versions of [NBFNet](https://github.com/KiddoZhu/NBFNet-PyG).
ULTRA does not learn any entity and relation embeddings specific to a downstream graph but instead obtains *relative relation representations* based on interactions between relations.

The original implementation with the TorchDrug framework is available [here](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ultra_torchdrug) for reproduction purposes.

This repository is based on PyTorch 2.1 and PyTorch-Geometric 2.4.

* **Jan 15th, 2024**: Accepted at [ICLR 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jVEoydFOl9)!
* **Dec 4th, 2023**: Added a new ULTRA checkpoint `ultra_50g` pre-trained on 50 graphs. Averaged over 16 larger transductive graphs, it delivers 0.389 MRR / 0.549 Hits@10 compared to 0.329 MRR / 0.479 Hits@10 of the `ultra_3g` checkpoint. The inductive performance is still as good! Use this checkpoint for inference on larger graphs.
* **Dec 4th, 2023**: Pre-trained ULTRA models (3g, 4g, 50g) are now also available on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/mgalkin/ultra-65699bb28369400a5827669d)! 

## Installation ##

You may install the dependencies via either conda or pip. 
Ultra PyG is implemented with Python 3.9, PyTorch 2.1 and PyG 2.4 (CUDA 11.8 or later when running on GPUs). If you are on a Mac, you may omit the CUDA toolkit requirements.

### From Conda ###

```bash
conda install pytorch=2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=11.8 cudatoolkit=11.8 pytorch-scatter=2.1.2 pyg=2.4.0 -c pytorch -c nvidia -c pyg -c conda-forge
conda install ninja easydict pyyaml -c conda-forge
```

### From Pip ###

```bash
pip install torch==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install torch-scatter==2.1.2 torch-sparse==0.6.18 torch-geometric==2.4.0 -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cu118.html
pip install ninja easydict pyyaml
```

<summary> Compilation of the `rspmm` kernel </summary>

To make relational message passing iteration `O(V)` instead of `O(E)` we ship a custom `rspmm` kernel that will be compiled automatically upon the first launch. The `rspmm` kernel supports `transe` and `distmult` message functions, others like `rotate` will resort to full edge materialization and `O(E)` complexity.

The kernel can be compiled on both CPUs (including M1/M2 on Macs) and GPUs (it is done only once and then cached). For GPUs, you need a CUDA 11.8+ toolkit with the `nvcc` compiler. If you are deploying this in a Docker container, make sure to start from the `devel` images that contain `nvcc` in addition to plain CUDA runtime.

Make sure your `CUDA_HOME` variable is set properly to avoid potential compilation errors, eg
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/
```

</details>


## Checkpoints ##

We provide two pre-trained ULTRA checkpoints in the `/ckpts` folder of the same model size (6-layer GNNs per relation and entity graphs, 64d, 168k total parameters) trained on 4 x A100 GPUs with this codebase:
* `ultra_3g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium` for 800,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/pretrain_3g.yaml`
* `ultra_4g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium, NELL995` for 400,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/pretrain_4g.yaml`

You can use those checkpoints for zero-shot inference on any graph (including your own) or use it as a backbone for fine-tuning. Both checkpoints are rather small (2 MB each).

Zero-shot performance of the checkpoints compared to the paper version (PyG experiments were run on a single RTX 3090, PyTorch 2.1, PyG 2.4, CUDA 11.8 using the `run_many.py` script in this repo):

## Run Inference and Fine-tuning

The `/scripts` folder contains 3 executable files:
* `run.py` - run an experiment on a single dataset
* `run_many.py` - run experiments on several datasets sequentially and dump results into a CSV file
* `pretrain.py` - a script for pre-training ULTRA on several graphs

The yaml configs in the `config` folder are provided for both `transductive` and `inductive` datasets.

### Run a single experiment

The `run.py` command requires the following arguments:
* `-c <yaml config>`: a path to the yaml config
* `--dataset`: dataset name (from the list of [datasets](#datasets))
* `--version`: a version of the inductive dataset (see all in [datasets](#datasets)), not needed for transductive graphs. For example, `--dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1` will load one of the GraIL inductive datasets.
* `--epochs`: number of epochs to train, `--epochs 0` means running zero-shot inference.
* `--bpe`: batches per epoch (replaces the length of the dataloader as default value). `--bpe 100 --epochs 10` means that each epoch consists of 100 batches, and overall training is 1000 batches. Set `--bpe null` to use the full length dataloader or comment the `bpe` line in the yaml configs.
* `--gpus`: number of gpu devices, set to `--gpus null` when running on CPUs, `--gpus [0]` for a single GPU, or otherwise set the number of GPUs for a [distributed setup](#distributed-setup)
* `--ckpt`: **full** path to the one of the ULTRA checkpoints to use (you can use those provided in the repo ot trained on your own). Use `--ckpt null` to start training from scratch (or run zero-shot inference on a randomly initialized model, it still might surprise you and demonstrate non-zero performance).

Zero-shot inference setup is `--epochs 0` with a given checkpoint `ckpt`.

Fine-tuning of a checkpoint is when epochs > 0 with a given checkpoint.


An example command for an inductive dataset to run on a CPU: 

```bash
python script/run.py -c config/inductive/inference.yaml --dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1 --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus null --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth
```

An example command for a transductive dataset to run on a GPU:
```bash
python script/run.py -c config/transductive/inference.yaml --dataset CoDExSmall --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth
```

### Run on many datasets

The `run_many.py` script is a convenient way to run evaluation (0-shot inference and fine-tuning) on several datasets sequentially. Upon completion, the script will generate a csv file `ultra_results_<timestamp>` with the test set results and chosen metrics. 
Using the same config files, you only need to specify:

* `-c <yaml config>`: use the full path to the yaml config because workdir will be reset after each dataset; 
* `-d, --datasets`: a comma-separated list of [datasets](#datasets) to run, inductive datasets use the `name:version` convention. For example, `-d ILPC2022:small,ILPC2022:large`;
* `--ckpt`: ULTRA checkpoint to run the experiments on, use the **full** path to the file;
* `--gpus`: the same as in [run single](#run-a-single-experiment);
* `-reps` (optional): number of repeats with different seeds, set by default to 1 for zero-shot inference;
* `-ft, --finetune` (optional): use the finetuning configs of ULTRA (`default_finetuning_config`) to fine-tune a given checkpoint for specified `epochs` and `bpe`;
* `-tr, --train` (optional): train ULTRA from scratch on the target dataset taking `epochs` and `bpe` parameters from another pre-defined config (`default_train_config`);
* `--epochs` and `--bpe` will be set according to a configuration, by default they are set for a 0-shot inference.

An example command to run 0-shot inference evaluation of an ULTRA checkpoint on 4 FB GraIL datasets:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

An example command to run fine-tuning on 4 FB GraIL datasets with 5 different seeds:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth --finetune --reps 5 -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

### Pretraining

Run the pre-training script `pretrain.py` with the `config/transductive/pretrain_<ngraphs>.yaml` config file. 

`graphs` in the config specify the pre-training mixture. `pretrain_3g.yaml` uses FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium; `pretrain_4g.yaml` adds NELL995 to those three. By default, we use the training option `fast_test: 500` to run faster evaluation on a random subset of 500 triples (that approximates full validation performance) of each validation set of the pre-training mixture.
You can change the pre-training length by varying batches per epoch `batch_per_epoch` and `epochs` hyperparameters.

<details>
<summary><b>On the training graph mixture</b></summary>

Right now, 10 transductive datasets are supported for the pre-training mixture in the `JointDataset`: 

* FB15k237
* WN18RR
* CoDExSmall
* CoDExMedium
* CoDExLarge
* NELL995
* YAGO310
* ConceptNet100k
* DBpedia100k
* AristoV4

You can add more datasets (from all 57 implemented as well as your custom ones) by modifying the `datasets_map` in `datasets.py`. By adding inductive datasets you'd need to add proper filtering datasets (similar to that in `test()` function in `run.py`) to have a consistent evaluation protocol.

</details>

An example command to start pre-training on 3 graphs:

```bash
python script/pretrain.py -c /path/to/config/transductive/pretrain_3g.yaml --gpus [0]
```

Pre-training can be computationally heavy, you might need to decrease the batch size for smaller GPU RAM. The two provided checkpoints were trained on 4 x A100 (40 GB).

#### Distributed setup
To run ULTRA with multiple GPUs, use the following commands (eg, 4 GPUs per node)

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 script/pretrain.py -c config/transductive/pretrain.yaml --gpus [0,1,2,3]
```

Multi-node setup might work as well(not tested):
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=4 --nproc_per_node=4 script/pretrain.py -c config/transductive/pretrain.yaml --gpus [0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3]
```

## Datasets

The repo packs 57 different KG datasets of sizes from 1K-120K nodes and 1K-2M edges. Inductive datasets have splits of different `version` and a common notation is `dataset:version`, eg `ILPC2022:small`

<details>

</details>


All the datasets will be automatically downloaded upon the first run. It is recommended to first download pre-training datasets on single GPU experiments rather than immediately start multi-GPU training to prevent racing conditions.

### Adding your own graph

We provide two base classes in `datasets.py` (based on [`InMemoryDataset`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.data.InMemoryDataset.html) of PyG) that you can inherit from:
* `TransductiveDataset` requires 3 links in the `urls` field by convention `urls = ["train_set_link", "valid_set_link", "test_set_link"]` and `name`. 
<details>
<summary>Code example</summary>

```python
class CustomDataset(TransductiveDataset):

    urls = [
        "link/to/train.txt",
        "link/to/valid.txt",
        "link/to/test.txt",
        ]
    name = "custom_data"
```
</details>

* `InductiveDataset` requires 4 links in the `urls` field by convention `urls = ["transductive_train_set_link", "inference_graph_link", "inference_valid_set_link", "inference_test_set_link"]` and `name`. By default, we assume that validation and test edges are based on `inference_graph` (but you can modify the loaders to account for different combinations).

<details>
<summary>Code example</summary>

```python
class CustomDataset(InductiveDataset):

    urls = [
        "link/to/train.txt",
        "link/to/inference_graph.txt",
        "link/to/inference_valid.txt",
        "link/to/inference_test.txt",
        ]
    name = "custom_data"
```
</details>

TSV / CSV files are supported by setting a delimiter (eg,  `delimiter = "\t"`) in the class definition. 
After adding your own dataset, you can immediately run 0-shot inference or fine-tuning of any ULTRA checkpoint.

## UltraQuery ##

You can now run complex logical queries on any KG with UltraQuery, an inductive query answering approach that uses any Ultra checkpoint with non-parametric fuzzy logic operators. Read more in the [new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07198).

Similar to Ultra, UltraQuery transfers to any KG in the zero-shot fashion and sets a few SOTA results on a variety of query answering benchmarks.

### Checkpoint ###

Any existing ULTRA checkpoint is compatible with UltraQuery but we also ship a newly trained `ultraquery.pth` checkpoint in the `ckpts` folder.

* A new `ultraquery.pth` checkpoint trained on complex queries from the `FB15k237LogicalQuery` dataset for 40,000 steps, the config is in `config/ultraquery/pretrain.yaml` - the same ULTRA architecture but tuned for the multi-source propagation needed in complex queries (no need for score thresholding)
* You can use any existing ULTRA checkpoint (`3g` / `4g` / `50g`) for starters - don't forget to set the `--threshold` argument to 0.8 or higher (depending on the dataset). Score thresholding is required because those models were trained on simple one-hop link prediction and there are certain issues (namely, the multi-source propagation issue, read Section 4.1 in the [new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07198) for more details)

### Performance

The numbers reported in the preprint were obtained with a model trained with TorchDrug. In this PyG implementation, we managed to get even better performance across the board with the `ultraquery.pth` checkpoint. 

`EPFO` is the averaged performance over 9 queries with relation projection, intersection, and union. `Neg` is the averaged performance over 5 queries with negation.

In particular, we reach SOTA on FB15k queries (0.764 MRR & 0.834 Hits@10 on EPFO; 0.567 MRR & 0.725 Hits@10 on negation) compared to much larger and heavier baselines (such as QTO).

### Run Inference ###

The running format is similar to the KG completion pipeline - use `run_query.py` and `run_query_many` for running a single expriment on one dataset or on a sequence of datasets. 
Due to the size of the datasets and query complexity, it is recommended to run inference on a GPU.

An example command for running transductive inference with UltraQuery on FB15k237 queries

```bash
python script/run_query.py -c config/ultraquery/transductive.yaml --dataset FB15k237LogicalQuery --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --bs 32 --threshold 0.0 --ultra_ckpt null --qe_ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultraquery.pth
```

An example command for running transductive inference with a vanilla Ultra 4g on FB15k237 queries with scores thresholding

```bash
python script/run_query.py -c config/ultraquery/transductive.yaml --dataset FB15k237LogicalQuery --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --bs 32 --threshold 0.8 --ultra_ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultra_4g.pth --qe_ckpt null
```

An example command for running inductive inference with UltraQuery on `InductiveFB15k237Query:550` queries

```bash
python script/run_query.py -c config/ultraquery/inductive.yaml --dataset InductiveFB15k237Query --version 550 --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --bs 32 --threshold 0.0 --ultra_ckpt null --qe_ckpt /path/to/ultra/ckpts/ultraquery.pth
```

New arguments for `_query` scripts:
* `--threshold`: set to 0.0 when using the main UltraQuery checkpoint `ultraquery.pth` or 0.8 (and higher) when using vanilla Ultra checkpoints
* `--qe_ckpt`: path to the UltraQuery checkpoint, set to `null` if you want to run vanilla Ultra checkpoints
* `--ultra_ckpt`: path to the original Ultra checkpoints, set to `null` if you want to run the UltraQuery checkpoint

### Datasets ###

23 new datasets available in `datasets_query.py` that will be automatically downloaded upon the first launch. 
All datasets include 14 standard query types (`1p`, `2p`, `3p`, `2i`, `3i`, `ip`, `pi`, `2u-DNF`, `up-DNF`, `2in`, `3in`,`inp`, `pin`, `pni`). 

The standard protocol is training on 10 patterns without unions and `ip`,`pi` queries (`1p`, `2p`, `3p`, `2i`, `3i`, `2in`, `3in`,`inp`, `pin`, `pni`) and running evaluation on all 14 patterns including `2u`, `up`, `ip`, `pi`.

<summary>Transductive query datasets (3)</summary>

All are the [BetaE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11465) versions of the datasets including queries with negation and limiting the max number of answers to 100
* `FB15k237LogicalQuery`, `FB15kLogicalQuery`, `NELL995LogicalQuery`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Inductive (e) query datasets (9)</summary>

9 inductive datasets extracted from FB15k237 - first proposed in [Inductive Logical Query Answering in Knowledge Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=-vXEN5rIABY) (NeurIPS 2022)

`InductiveFB15k237Query` with 9 versions where the number shows the how large is the inference graph compared to the train graph (in the number of nodes):
* `550`, `300`, `217`, `175`, `150`, `134`, `122`, `113`, `106` 

In addition, we include the `InductiveFB15k237QueryExtendedEval` dataset with the same versions. Those are supposed to be inference-only datasets that measure the _faithfulness_ of complex query answering approaches. In each split, as validation and test graphs extend the train graphs with more nodes and edges, training queries now have more true answers achievable by simple edge traversal (no missing link prediction required) - the task is to measure how well CLQA models can retrieve new easy answers on training queries but on larger unseen graphs.

<details>
<summary>Inductive (e,r) query datasets (11)</summary>

11 new inductive query datasets (WikiTopics-CLQA) that we built specifically for testing UltraQuery.
The queries were sampled from the WikiTopics splits proposed in [Double Equivariance for Inductive Link Prediction for Both New Nodes and New Relation Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01313)

`WikiTopicsQuery` with 11 versions
* `art`, `award`, `edu`, `health`, `infra`, `loc`, `org`, `people`, `sci`, `sport`, `tax` 

</details>

### Metrics

New metrics include `auroc`, `spearmanr`, `mape`. We don't support Mean Rank `mr` in complex queries. If you ever see `nan` in one of those metrics, consider reducing the batch size as those metrics are computed with the variadic functions that might be numerically unstable on large batches.

## ULTRA-LM ##
ULTRA-LM (Language Model Integration for ULTRA) is a new variant of ULTRA that integrates a language model embeddings into the KG reasoning pipeline. We assume that each entity has a textual description and we use a pre-trained language model to encode those descriptions into embeddings.</br>
ULTRA-LM architecture is inspired by [Galkin's suggestion](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ULTRA/issues/9).

### Blogpost
TBD Soon!

### Dataset
Currently, we provide one dataset supporting ULTRA-LM - `RedHatCVE` - a dataset of security vulnerabilities with textual descriptions. </br>
The dataset inherit the `TransductiveDataset` class, the valid and test splits contains only unseen CVEs, thus the dataset is inductive (node-wise) in nature. The embeddings are obtained from the `OpenAI Ada`, however, you can use any other language model.</br>

The original goal of the dataset is to predict the `cpe` (Common Platform Enumeration) of a given vulnerability. Therefore, we are mostly intrested in the `MatchingCVE` (head prediction) relation type during the evaluation. Complete details on the dataset can be found in [VulnScopper pre-print](https://deepness-lab.org/publications/unveiling-hidden-links-between-unseen-security-entities/).

### Running ULTRA-LM
To run ULTRA-LM, you need to download the pre-trained language model embeddings from [here](https://github.com/acsac24submissionvulnscopper/VulnScopper/releases/download/dataset/redhat_entity2vec.pickle).</br> Place the file within ULTRA's root directory (or any inner directory). 

**IMPORTANT!** Remember to replace `lm_vectors` parameter with the complete path (from the root, without using `~`) to the `redhat_entity2vec.pickle` file in the `config/ultralm/pretrain.yaml` configuration file.

To run ULTRA-LM with multiple GPUs, use the following commands:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 script/pretrain_lm.py -c config/ultralm/pretrain.yaml --dataset RedHatCVE --epochs 10 --bpe null --gpus [0,1]
```
